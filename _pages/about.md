I am a D.Eng. student majoring in Mechanics at [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/) in the School of Aerospace Engineering and Applied Mechanics. My doctoral research is supervised by [Ying Zhao](http://www.yingzhaotj.cn/). 

Previously, I completed an M.Eng. in Mechanics at the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics ([NUAA](http://nuaa.edu.cn/)), supervised by [Huiyu Sun](http://faculty.nuaa.edu.cn/shy/en/index/18666/list/index.htm). Before joining NUAA, I earned a B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering at the National Technological Institute of Mexico, campus Mérida ([ITM](https://www.merida.tecnm.mx/)). 

During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a research assistant at the Yucatan Scientific Research Center ([CICY](https://www.cicy.mx/english)) and the Autonomous University of Yucatan ([UADY](https://en.uady.mx/)), supervised by [Pedro Herrera-Franco](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pedro-Herrera-Franco) and [M. A. Lucio-Garcia](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lucio-Monica-Arely). 

My work has been funded by the China Scholarship Council (CSC) and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government.
