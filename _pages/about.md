Hi there! I am a D.Eng. student majoring in Mechanics at Tongji University in the School of Aerospace Engineering and Applied Mechanics. My doctoral research is supervised by [Ying Zhao](http://www.yingzhaotj.cn/). Previously, I completed an M.Eng. in Mechanics at the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics ([NUAA](http://nuaa.edu.cn/)) supervised by [Huiyu Sun](http://faculty.nuaa.edu.cn/shy/en/index/18666/list/index.htm). Before joining NUAA, I completed a B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering at the National Technological Institute of Mexico. During my undergrad studies, I worked as a research assistant at [CICY](https://www.cicy.mx/english) on polymer composite materials projects supervised by [Pedro Herrera-Franco](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pedro-Herrera-Franco) (retired). My work has been funded by the [China Scholarship Council](https://www.campuschina.org/index.html) and the [Shanghai Municipal People's Government](https://english.shanghai.gov.cn/en-ApplyforScholarships/index.html).
